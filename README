DESCRIPTION
    This module converts a Japanese stock symbol code to the name of
    company. Japanese stock markets use 4-digit code number as stock symbol.
    You can get either English or Japanese name of company.

FUNCTIONS
    sym2name($symbol [, $lang])
        This function returns a string of the name of company from $symbol
        (a stock symbol code of 4-digit number).

        In case it were a missing code number, the module returns string
        '(n/a)';

        $lang attribute specifies language mode of the company's name. A
        $lang value is 'eng' (in English) or 'jpn' (in Japanese). This
        attribute is omittable and the default value is 'eng'.

        Note that string data under 'jpn' $lang mode is encoded with UTF-8
        character encoding.
